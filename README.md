🌟 Operating System – Assignment 2

This repository contains my Operating Systems Assignment 2, implemented in C using the GCC compiler.
It includes several example programs demonstrating compilation, linking, loading, and Makefile usage.

🛠️ Installation

Make sure GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is installed:

sudo apt install gcc

📂 Repository Contents
file1.c
file2.c
file3.c
file4.c
makefile
code Explanation, Screenshots.pdf
Linker VS Loader.txt

📘 How to Use
1️⃣ Read Documentation

Before running the programs, check:

code Explanation, Screenshots.pdf
→ This file explains what each program does.

2️⃣ Using the Makefile

You can run all programs easily with make:

make            # Build and run all tasks
make task1      # Run Task 1
make task2      # Run Task 2
make task3      # Run Task 3
make clean      # Remove generated output files

3️⃣ Running Programs Manually with GCC

You may also compile each file manually:

gcc file1.c -o simple_pro


Replace Task-1.c with the file you want to run.
The output executable will be named simple_pro.
